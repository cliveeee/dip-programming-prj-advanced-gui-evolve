## ISSUES

---

1. Identify a Bug: When you Identify a bug during the debugging process, and you intend to fix it you create an issue on GitHub.
2. Add a description and comment: Make sure that the description of the issue is clear with the issue number and add a comment describing the issue. The issue is reserved for the maker unless open-to-all tag is added.
3. Add a tag/label to the issue for example bug, enhancement, help wanted, priority: high, priority: low
4. Add the ready-for-work tag to an open issue when prepared to start working on it. This lets other programmers know that someone is working on the issue in their local IDE. By doing so, collisions are avoided.
5. Create a Branch: Before you start fixing the issue in your local IDE open your terminal, create a new branch using this command git check out -b <issue number>.
6. Fix the issue - create a test. When your test passes push the changes
7. Create a pull request: Create a pull request and associate it with the issue number on the pull request description for example if the issue is issue # 1 the pull request description will include Fixes #1 in the description so that when you merge changes the issue closes automatically.
8. Code Review - The project maintainers will review the code. Once approved changes will be merged into the main branch
9. Closing Issue - The issue is closed automatically by GitHub if step 3 was followed correctly
